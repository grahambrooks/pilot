Pilot is a web application that can help learn about application deployment.

Design principles:

    Minimal dependencies - dependencies make an application more difficult to deploy so minimising dependencies helps
    make Pilot more applicable in more areas.

    Minimal environmental requirements - similar to minimising dependencies. As far as possible Pilot should be
    deployable into any Java web environment.
